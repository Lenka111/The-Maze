# The-Maze
The maze game has a start entrance position and an exit or finishing position.
Cells 3 through 9 were added to this starter code as instructed. Cell number 9 contains the
exit from the maze. The score variable holds the amount of moves the user makes in each cell
and updates in the end the total moves it took to find the finish point. When user finds the exit, a congratulation message is displayed and the game ends.

*Made it possible for the users who play this game to avoid getting stuck in cells when choosing the wrong move (as it was the case in the beginning).

*if statements were included for all cells in the, even those that are not in the escape cell sequence for the maze (User has the possibility to navigate between cells , ex: from cell 9 user can go up to cell 6 or go left to cell 7 and so on.)
